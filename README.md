# This repository container my master thesis.

(Please don't hold it against me.)

This thesis was done with as little work as possible, to get my studies wrapped up. 

My thesis is about combining existing datasets, like stereo data and semantic segmentation data into one dataset, and model.

This would make it little bit easier to train depth map analysis with information about objects in the detection field.

Master thesis itself is in latex format base for it, it from [Tunis repo](https://gitlab.com/tuni-official/thesis-templates/masters-thesis) but I have just copied the files here without git history. There might have been one re pull and migration due to some package mismatch. If I remember correctly. 

The work itself is published in Trepo
