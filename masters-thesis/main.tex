%% Congratulations, you've made an excellent choice
%% of writing your Tampere University thesis using
%% the LaTeX system. This document attempts to be
%% as complete a template as possible to let you focus
%% on the most important part: the writing itself.
%% Thus the details regarding the visual appearance
%% and even structure have already been worked out
%% for you!
%%
%% I sincerely hope you will find this template useful
%% in completing your thesis project. I've tried to
%% add comments (followed by the % sign) to clarify
%% the structure and purpose of some of the commands.
%% Most of the magic happens in the file tauthesis.cls,
%% which you are more than welcome to take a look at.
%% Just refrain from editing it in the most crucial
%% versions of the thesis!
%%
%% I wish you and your thesis project the best of luck!
%% If this template causes you trouble along the way
%% or if you've any suggestions for improving it,
%% please be in contact through GitHub

% commands. Put the \abstract in the primary language first and the

% Finnish only need the first abstract. The second argument of the \preface
% command takes the place where the thesis was signed in.

%%%%% Lists of figures, tables, listings and terms.

% figures/tables, listing them may be a good idea.
