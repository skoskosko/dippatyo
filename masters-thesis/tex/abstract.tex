In Machine learning usually one of the hardest tasks is collecting sufficien data.
This thesis tries to combine two more available data types intoa model which can be used for generating realistic depthmaps.

This is done with segmentation and stereo data.

For handling this data, semantic segmentation and depth generated from stereopictures is used
alongside with simple algorithmic solutions for estimating depth behind detected objects.

Due to model being automatically generated, it is most likely very reliable.
But the end result should be enough for some none critical applications.
